### Notes

_This is the place where you can put TODO notes while developing some feature. Empty all the content below this notice when you are finished with development. When in `master` branch, the notes should be empty._

- // {path: '', component: LandingPageComponent}, TODO: chat with others if this is OK
- extensively test if everything about shared and admin modules work as intended. might be a thin ice if not tested properly. try to make a production build and see how it behaves.
